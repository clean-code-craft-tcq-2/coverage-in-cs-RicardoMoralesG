# Prove and Cover the code

This project uses the Xunit framework to test functionality.
[See here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/testing/unit-testing-with-dotnet-test)
for details.

## The task

Code coverage is low. Expand the tests to take care of the variations. Track and improve the coverage.

Hint: Test the abstractions, instead of just end-to-end tests.

Uncovered lines indicate an opportunity to write tests.

> Caution: High coverage doesn't indicate no bugs!
